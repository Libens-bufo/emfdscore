# ‚ù§ py-amore: Automated Morality Extraction for Python

The Automated Morality Extractor (AMorE) is a Python library for the fast and flexible extraction of various moral information metrics from textual input data. AMoRe is build on [spaCy](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy) for faster execution and performs minimal preprocessing consisting of tokenziation, syntactic dependency parsing, lower-casing, and stopword/punctuation/whitespace removal. AMorE lets users employ and compare **multiple Moral Foundations Dictionaries**, provides **various metrics for analyzing moral information**, and extracts **moral patient, agent, and attribute words** related to entities.

AMorE can be installed via pip: `pip install py-amore`

## Install 
AMorE requires a Python installation (v3.5+). If your machine does not have installed, we recommend installing Python by downloading and installing either [Anaconda or Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/continuumio-conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) for your OS. 

## Usage 
TODO.

AMorE lets users choose between three dictionaries when scoring documents: 

1.) The extended Moral Foundations Dictionary (e-MFD; under review) 

2.) The Moral Foundations Dicitonary 2.0 (Frimer et al., 2017; https://osf.io/xakyw/ )

3.) The original Moral Foundations Dictionary (https://moralfoundations.org/othermaterials) 

## Returned metrics
TODO.
